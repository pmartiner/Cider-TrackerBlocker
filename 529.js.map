It is *very fast* in finding potential candidates.\n *\n * Conceptually, the reverse index dispatches filters in \"buckets\" (an array of\n * one or more filters). Filters living in the same bucket are guaranteed to\n * share at least one of their tokens (appearing in the pattern). For example:\n *\n *   - Bucket 1 (ads):\n *       - /ads.js\n *       - /script/ads/tracking.js\n *       - /ads/\n *   - Bucket 2 (tracking)\n *       - /tracking.js\n *       - ||tracking.com/cdn\n *\n * We see that filters in \"Bucket 1\" are indexed using the token \"ads\" and\n * \"Bucket 2\" using token \"tracking\".\n *\n * This property allows to quickly discard most of the filters when we match a\n * URL. To achieve this, the URL is tokenized in the same way filters are\n * tokenized and for each token, we check if there are some filters available.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n *  URL \"https://tracking.com/\" has the following tokens: \"https\", \"tracking\"\n *  and \"com\". We immediatly see that we only check the two filters in the\n *  \"tracking\" bucket since they are the only ones having a common token with\n *  the URL.\n *\n * How do we pick the token for each filter?\n * =========================================\n *\n * Each filter is only indexed *once*, which means that we need to pick one of\n * the tokens appearing in the pattern. We choose the token such that each\n * filter is indexed using the token which was the *least seen* globally. In\n * other words, we pick the most discriminative token for each filter. This is\n * done using the following algorithm:\n *   1. Tokenize all the filters which will be stored in the index\n *   2. Compute a histogram of frequency of each token (globally)\n *   3. Select the best token for each filter (lowest frequency)\n */\nexport default class ReverseIndex {\n    constructor({ deserialize, filters, optimize, config, }) {\n        // Internal, compact representation of the reverse index.

It is an approximate dispatch\n        // table which maps a mask of N bits (N being smaller than 31 bits, the size\n        // of a token) to a list of buckets having a 'token' sharing these same N\n        // bits sub-set. If the binary representation of the token for bucket1 is\n        // 101010 and suffix has size 3, then we would lookup the \"tokens lookup\n        // index\" using the last 3 bits \"010\" which would give us the offset in our\n        // typed array where we can start reading the filters of buckets having a\n        // token ending with the same 3 bits.

The\n        // structure is: token, filter, token, filter, etc. To identify all the\n        // filters indexed with 'token' a naive approach would be to iterate on\n        // \"buckets index\" and collect all the filters indexed with 'token'.
